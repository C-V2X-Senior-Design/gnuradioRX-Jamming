# Jammer

The jammer we are using is a modified version of one written by YaYa Brown and Cynthia Teng of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This jammer does not work with the latest version of gnuradio due to the `ofdm mod` block being phased out. The workaround to this was to use a docker image provided by our graduate student advisor and client, Stefan Gvozdenovic, which uses gnuradio version 3.7.11. The docker image is available [here](https://github.com/gefa/cv2x-docker-grc3.7).

YaYa Brown and Cynthia Teng's paper (which links to jammer) is available [here](https://digital.wpi.edu/concern/student_works/hm50tv580?locale=en) and the citation for their work is the following:

# Jammer Modifications

The following modifications were made to the jammer code:
* `random.randrange(2.6775e9,2.6825e9,1e3))` changed to `random.randrange(5.9165e9,5.917e9,1e3)` (center frequency)
* `time.sleep(1.0 / (40))` changed to `time.sleep(1.0)` (duration between jamming frequency hopping)



# Receiver

Our receiver code for data collection and visualization was written in gnuradio:
